Unit 1 & Unit 2 Assignments - Java Programming
Welcome to the Unit 1 & Unit 2 Assignments repository! This repository contains Java programming assignments for both Unit 1 and Unit 2, providing practical examples of various programming concepts.


ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


Unit 1 Assignments : 

The code files outside the Unit 2 folder are part of Unit 1 Assignments. These include foundational programming practices like constructors, string manipulations, and basic operations.

Unit 2 Folder : 

The Unit 2 folder contains code for Unit 2 Assignments, covering intermediate topics such as recursion, inheritance, garbage collection, and other important concepts.

Menu-Driven Code:

A file has been created containing a Menu-Driven code that allows users to easily navigate and execute different programs from both Unit 1 and Unit 2 assignments directly. This ensures seamless access to any of the assignments and their outputs, making it easier for users to explore different solutions.


âœ¨ Key Features
Unit 1 Concepts: Includes basic programming skills like working with constructors, performing mathematical operations, string manipulations, and simple control structures.


Unit 2 Concepts: Covers intermediate-level concepts such as recursion, inheritance, garbage collection, and more complex object-oriented programming techniques.


Menu-Driven Access: A menu-driven program is provided, allowing users to select and run any assignment from Unit 1 or Unit 2 with ease. This makes it user-friendly for testing and exploring different Java concepts.


Self-Contained Solutions: Each Java file is dedicated to solving a specific assignment or demonstrating a concept, making them easy to understand and test.


ðŸ“š Additional Notes

Some assignments from Unit 1 and Unit 2 may have overlapping concepts, but they provide different examples to strengthen your understanding.

The examples are written in clear and simple Java code, perfect for beginners or anyone looking to strengthen their knowledge of Java programming.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the solutions, and use this repository as a resource for learning and enhancing your Java programming skills.
